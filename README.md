# DistanceToPolygonOnMaps

This document covers how to parse KML files (with polygon) to Swift MKMap.

KML or Keyhole Markup Language is an XML notation for expressing geographic annotation and visualization within Internet-based, 
two-dimensional maps and three-dimensional Earth browsers. 
KML was developed for use with Google Earth, which was originally named Keyhole Earth Viewer.

#Step 1:#
Download apple's samle code [here.](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/KMLViewer/Listings/Classes_KMLParser_m.html)

#Step 2:#
Bridge KMLParser.m and KMLParser.h files from Apple's sample code to your project ( you can just drag it to your project )
If you never done it before, [you can find a simple tutorial here.](https://www.ios-blog.com/tutorials/objective-c/how-to-use-objective-c-classes-in-swift/)

#Step 3:#
Add your KML File to your project in Xcode.

#Step 4:#
Parsing and Adding the polygon to MKMap
